# World exploration

Initially all person know nothing about the world. It is also true for the player person. They can see only a part of current location in the one moment of time. Then a person moves to another position in the location he can't see objects and terrain point that comes too far. Invisible but known parts of the location are covered by the fog of war (FoW).

The FoW hides some objects of the world. It happens with other persons and monsters. Because they usualy do some activities unknow be the person.

Other location objects comes semi-transparent. Player can see this objects because they stay unchanged for a long time.
