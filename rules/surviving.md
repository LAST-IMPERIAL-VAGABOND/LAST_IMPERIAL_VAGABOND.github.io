# Surviving

This is main components of gameplay. The player person must heal *wounds to stay alive*. Then the player person die the game ends. Another way to heal a little is resting in a [camp](camp.md).

Also the person must eat food then he is suffer by *hunger* and drink liquds the he suffer by *thist*. The person begin to slowly die if starvation or dehydration come to critical value. But weak hunger or thristy decrease the person characteristics. So it make to perform actions harder and dangerous.

Some things are *toxic*. Consuming they increase the person toxication which is as dangerous as hunger or thristy.

Different resources have different impacts according [usage rules](resource-usage-rules.md). Resources which person consumes can have some [restrictions](resource-usage-restrictions.md).

The person may get some items to suvive by killing monsters or searching chest or any other boxes in locations.
